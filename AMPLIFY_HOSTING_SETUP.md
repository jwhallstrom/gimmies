---

## Step-by-Step: Connect GitHub to Amplify Hosting

### 1. Open AWS Amplify Console
**URL:** https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1

### 2. Create New Hosting App
1. Click **"New app"** (orange button, top right)
2. Select **"Host web app"**
3. Choose **"GitHub"** as the repository provider
4. Click **"Continue"**

### 3. Authorize GitHub Access
1. Click **"Authorize AWS Amplify"**
2. Sign in to GitHub if prompted
3. Grant Amplify access to your repositories

### 4. Select Repository & Branch
1. **Repository:** `Talbot24/gimmies-golf-pwa`
2. **Branch:** `master`
3. Click **"Next"**

### 5. Configure Build Settings
Amplify should auto-detect your `amplify.yml`. Verify:

```yaml
Build command: npm run build
Output directory: dist
```

**IMPORTANT:** Check **"Connecting to an existing backend"**
- This links your frontend to the existing Amplify Gen 2 backend (sandbox)

### 6. Add Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
Click **"Advanced settings"** and add:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `VITE_ENABLE_CLOUD_SYNC` | `true` |

**Note:** `amplify_outputs.json` is auto-generated during build from your backend

### 7. Review and Deploy
1. Review all settings
2. Click **"Save and deploy"**
3. Wait for build to complete (~3-5 minutes)

## What Happens During Deployment

### Phase 1: Provision (30 sec)
- Creates CloudFront distribution
- Sets up build environment
- Configures SSL/TLS certificate

### Phase 2: Build (2-3 min)
```bash
npm ci                    # Install dependencies
npm run build             # Build production bundle
```

### Phase 3: Deploy (1-2 min)
- Uploads dist/ to CloudFront
- Invalidates cache
- Activates new version

### Phase 4: Verify (30 sec)
- Runs post-deployment checks
- Generates deployment URL

---

## Expected Deployment URL

Your app will be available at:
```
https://master.<app-id>.amplifyapp.com
```

Example:
```
https://master.d3abc123xyz.amplifyapp.com
```

**CloudFront Features Included:**
- ✅ HTTPS automatically enabled
- ✅ Global CDN (fast worldwide)
- ✅ Automatic certificate management
- ✅ Custom domain support (if needed)

---

## Post-Deployment: Verify Features

### 1. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Login page loads correctly
- [ ] Google OAuth redirects work
- [ ] Email/password sign-in functional
- [ ] Sign-up flow completes
- [ ] Password reset works
- [ ] Cognito user pool receives users

### 2. Data Sync (DynamoDB)
- [ ] Create new event
- [ ] Event saves to cloud
- [ ] Event appears on second device
- [ ] Scorecard data syncs
- [ ] Profile data persists

### 3. Real-time Features
- [ ] Live score updates
- [ ] Chat messages sync instantly
- [ ] Event completion triggers alerts
- [ ] Leaderboard updates in real-time

### 4. Analytics
- [ ] CompletedRounds display correctly
- [ ] 18 holes shown (not 36) ✅ (fixed Oct 14)
- [ ] Stats calculate properly
- [ ] Cross-device consistency

### 5. PWA Features
- [ ] Service worker registers
- [ ] Offline mode works
- [ ] Add to home screen prompt
- [ ] Push notifications (if enabled)

---

## Auto-Deployment (CI/CD)

After setup, every git push triggers automatic deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin master
# ↓ Amplify auto-detects push
# ↓ Starts new build
# ↓ Deploys to production
# ↓ Live in ~5 minutes
```

**Build Status:**
- View in Amplify Console → "Build history"
- Email notifications on build success/failure

---

## Monitoring & Logs

### Build Logs
- Amplify Console → App → Build history → Click build
- Shows npm install, build, deploy steps
- Debug build failures here

### Runtime Logs (CloudWatch)
- Console → Monitoring → Logs
- View CloudFront access logs
- Track API requests to AppSync

### Performance Metrics
- Console → Monitoring → Performance
- Page load times
- CloudFront cache hit rates

---

## Connecting Backend (Sandbox → Production)

**CURRENT:** Using sandbox backend (`victo-sandbox`)
**PRODUCTION:** You may want a dedicated production backend

### Option A: Keep Sandbox for Now
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ Same backend for dev and prod
- ⚠️ Single environment

### Option B: Create Production Backend (Recommended Later)
```bash
npx ampx generate outputs --branch main --app-id <your-amplify-app-id>
```
This creates a production backend stack separate from sandbox.

**For now, stick with Option A** until you validate everything works.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: "Module not found"
**Fix:** Check `package.json` dependencies are complete
```bash
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push
```

### amplify_outputs.json Not Found
**Fix:** In Amplify Console → App settings → Build settings:
- Ensure "Connect existing backend" is checked
- Backend environment should be `victo-sandbox`

### Authentication Redirects Fail
**Fix:** Update Cognito redirect URLs:
1. Go to Cognito Console
2. User Pools → `us-east-1_IpbwW1NCP`
3. App integration → App client settings
4. Add: `https://master.<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`

### Service Worker Issues
**Fix:** Hard refresh after deployment
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Application → Service Workers → Unregister

## Cost Estimate (Amplify Hosting)

### Free Tier (First 12 months)
- **Build minutes:** 1,000/month FREE
- **Data served:** 15 GB/month FREE
- **Data stored:** 5 GB FREE

### After Free Tier (Small App)
- **Builds:** ~10 builds/month × $0.01 = **$0.10**
- **Serving:** ~5 GB/month × $0.15/GB = **$0.75**
- **Storage:** 100 MB × $0.023/GB = **$0.002**

**Total:** ~$0.85-1/month for small golf app

### Backend Costs (Separate)
- Cognito: Free for <50k users
- AppSync: Free tier covers small usage
- DynamoDB: Free tier covers small apps

**Combined estimated monthly cost: $0-5**
